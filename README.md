This project is result of submission to the ETH AI Center GainForest Hackathon for XPrize.

The project repository contains Deepforest and DETECT-TREE2 models, which are image segmentation models.

Initially, the App asks user to upload an .jpb Panoramic image, it is automatically segmented and the output is a excel file with co-ordinates.

The segmented trees from the panoramic images are compared with identified species and results are generated on this.

The identification/classification is done using a VGG-16 model which is pretrained on 1 million images.

Testing of this model is done by a Dataset created for this project: https://segments.ai/r/drone-panoramic/.

This dataset has species annotated in the panoramic images. The results of the classification from the VGG or any other model can be tested with this dataset.
