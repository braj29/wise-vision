This project is result of submission to the ETH AI Center GainForest Hackathon for XPrize. This project and its dataset is selected among 3 others for preprocessing for the XPRIZE Finale (8 others selected for deployment) by the BiodivX Team (one of the six finalists for the $ 10M XPRIZE)

The APP is hosted on HuggingFace Spaces, check out: https://huggingface.co/spaces/TeamWiseVision/Wise-Vision-App . (PS: Due to some git issues the data for classification was not fully added hence the pipeline is not fully complete)

You can also find full details in the poster created for this project in this repo's root directory.

The project repository contains Deepforest and DETECT-TREE2 models, which are image segmentation models.

Initially, the App asks user to upload an .jpb Panoramic image, it is automatically segmented and the output is a excel file with co-ordinates.

The segmented trees from the panoramic images are compared with identified species and results are generated on this.

The identification/classification is done using a VGG-16 model which is pretrained on 1 million images.

Testing of this model is done by a Dataset created for this project: https://segments.ai/r/drone-panoramic/.

This dataset has species annotated in the panoramic images. The results of the classification from the VGG or any other model can be tested with this dataset.
